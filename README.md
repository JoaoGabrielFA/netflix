## Introduction

This is a [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse) clone project developed as part of my learning in React.JS. I used the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) to fetch all movie and TV show data. The main goal of this project is to enhance my front-end development skills as I recreate the attractive and modern interface of Netflix.

## How It Works

### Pages
