# Introduction

This is a [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse) clone project developed as part of my learning in React.JS. I used the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) to fetch all movie and TV show data. The main goal of this project is to enhance my front-end development skills as I recreate the attractive and modern interface of Netflix.

# How It Works

## Pages

![Navbar Exemple Gif](https://github.com/JoaoGabrielFA/netflix/assets/112104535/f6173d07-fd65-434f-b578-f9644fb2a0a3)

You can access the pages from the top navbar (bottom on mobile). Here's a brief description of each one:

- **Home** 
> Here, the trending and top-rated shows are displayed.

- **Tv Shows** 
> Here, the most popular tv shows of each genre are displayed.

- **Movies** 
> Here, the most popular movies of each genre are displayed.

- **News & Popular** 
> Here, upcoming notable releases are displayed.

- **My List** 
> Here, all the shows you've added to your list are displayed.

## Search

You can add shows to "My List" by clicking the plus sign (+) on the card or the show page, and to remove, you just need to click again.

## Play
